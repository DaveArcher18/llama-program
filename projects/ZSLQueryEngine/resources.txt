Nice examples of prompt engineering here, such as add 'a type of food' onto the end of the labels of food items.

The empirical results and heuristics seems to agree with regard to the fact 
that a more specific (richer) label performs better than a less specific labels:
so 'a photo of a dog running' is a better label than 'dog'. 

Specifically, adding the label's superceding class also increases accuracy:
'dog' vs 'dog, pet' or 'dog, animal'

Hypothesis: Simply adding more desciptive words to the labels will improve accuray, potentially leveraging some kind
of pretrained image to text architecture 

The process of algorithmically lengthening labels in some sort of consistent way that 
preserves information should be investigated 

The idea of ensembling labels has been mentioned in this paper - this is definitely 
something that should be investigated in some sort of algorithmic way.

It appears to be the case that ZSL is particularly difficult to implement accurately when it comes to highly complex and or
specific tasks (which seems very reasonanle)
Interstingly enough - in some cases zero shot performs better than few shot learning pg 9 right ^


"As in the preceding visual, we find that repeating the caption with alternative phrasing improves the consistency of the results."
"While DALLÂ·E does offer some level of controllability over the attributes and positions of a small number of objects, the success rate can depend on how the caption is phrased."

Minute 15ish 
Consider teaching GPT-3 to classify words as their object type (eg : avocado ~ type of food) 
The overall plan for this idea will be to train a trnasformer to take a word and return its 
object category, such as 'fruit' or 'vegetable' or 'vehicle' or things of this nature in order 
to provide more context to CLIP's own transformer when processing the label.

There is a necessity for good prompt engineering (not much else was said).

Fun article but nothing particularly useful

This article concerns controlling GPT-3's behaviour by prompting it. I think it is both interesting and useful
but not for this project
