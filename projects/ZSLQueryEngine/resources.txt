The empirical results and heuristics seems to agree with regard to the fact 
that a more specific (richer) label performs better than a less specific labels:
so 'a photo of a dog running' is a better label than 'dog'. 

Specifically, adding the label's superceding class also increases accuracy:
'dog' vs 'dog, pet' or 'dog, animal'

Hypothesis: Simply adding more desciptive words to the labels will improve accuray, potentially leveraging some kind
of pretrained image to text architecture 

The process of algorithmically lengthening labels in some sort of consistent way that 
preserves information should be investigated 

The idea of ensembling labels has been mentioned in this paper - this is definitely 
something that should be investigated in some sort of algorithmic way.

It appears to be the case that ZSL is particularly difficult to implement accurately when it comes to highly complex and or
specific tasks (which seems very reasonanle)
Interstingly enough - in some cases zero shot performs better than few shot learning pg 9 right ^
